// "Replay" data is an array of timestamps + bitmaps of which keys are pressed down at that moment
// A new timestamp + bitmap is recorded when the state of one of the keys change; every timestamp corresponds to at least 1 key becoming pressed or unpressed
// Timestamps are relative to the first note in the chart; 0ms timestamp = +0ms relative to the first note
// This is so a replay is portable to a functionally identical copy of the chart other than its offset being shifted

// ex: [|(0, 0); (1, 1)|] indicates that the leftmost (1st) column was pressed down, 1 ms into the chart AKA 1ms after the first note

// ChartTime is conventionally used as the type signature instead of Time when the time is relative to the first note instead of to the start of the audio file
